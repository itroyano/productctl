# productctl

A power tool for [Red Hat Software Certification
Partners](https://connect.redhat.com/en/benefits).

Use `productctl` to create and iterate on your Red Hat Certified Product listing
metadata from the comfort of your favorite text editor. Then, apply your changes
and validate your content from your Partner dashboard.

## High Level Workflow

1. Scaffold your new Product Listing (or fetch an existing one)

```bash
productctl product create [--from-discovery-json /path/to/discovery.json] my.product.yaml
```

Or fetch an existing listing:

```bash
productctl product fetch 000111222333 > my.product.yaml
```

2. Make alterations to your Product Listing, add/remove components, etc.

3. Apply your Product Listing

```bash
productctl product apply my.product.yaml
```

4. Repeat until all metadata is configured to your liking.
